# ü§ñ Admittance Control for Reducing Human Physical Effort in Robot Programming through Motion Guidance

This repository contains Python scripts for experimental validation of **admittance control** using a **UR3 collaborative robot**. The main goal is to reduce the **physical effort** required by operators during linear trajectory programming, simulating dynamic behavior through force interaction.

It includes:

- **Control Robot**: Uses an admittance-based velocity controller (mass-spring-damper model) constrained to the **X-axis**, replacing freedrive with a more ergonomic and controllable method.
- **Disturbance Robot**: Applies **sinusoidal forces** to evaluate how the control robot responds under dynamic interaction.

## üß™ Research Context & Contributions

This project supports a study on reducing operator effort in collaborative robot programming. Key contributions include:

- ‚úÖ Demonstrated a **mass-based admittance control model** to reduce user-applied force.
- ‚úÖ Showed **feasibility** of admittance control on UR3 (which lacks torque-level control).
- ‚úÖ Provided a **low-complexity alternative** to adaptive and learning-based methods.
- ‚úÖ Applied motion constraint to **X-axis** to isolate force interaction.
- ‚úÖ Enabled comparison against UR‚Äôs native **freedrive mode**.

This framework was used in a peer-reviewed study focused on ergonomic, force-guided programming for collaborative robots.

## üî® Experimental Setup

Two types of experiments were conducted:

### üîπ Circuit to Read Force from FSR

A voltage divider with an Arduino measures force from an FSR sensor, sending values via serial to the control script.

### üîπ Experiment 1: Without Disturbance

- One UR3 robot controlled by the user
- Tested control modes:
  - UR **Freedrive**
  - **Admittance control** with masses: `1 kg`, `5 kg`, `10 kg`
- Motion constrained to the X-axis (linear)
- Goal: evaluate force reduction vs. freedrive

### üîπ Experiment 2: With Disturbance (Sinusoidal Load)

- Two UR3 robots, mechanically connected
- Control Robot: same as in Experiment 1
- Disturbance Robot: applies sinusoidal load via Force Mode
- Goal: evaluate robustness of admittance control and freedrive under dynamic forces

### üß™ Step-by-Step

1. **Upload `force_sensor_FSR.ino`** to Arduino and connect it to **Computer 1**.
2. **Connect Computer 1** to the **Control UR3**, set IP, and test with option `25`.
3. **Run Freedrive** (option `2`) or **Admittance** (option `6`, adjust mass in script).
4. *(Optional)* Connect **Computer 2** to the **Disturbance UR3**, set IP.
5. Run `Disturbance_Robot.py`, select option `25` to go to start pose.
6. Mechanically connect both robots.
7. On Computer 2, start force injection with **option `9`**.
8. On Control Robot, run option `2` or `6` depending on test type.
9. Data is saved in `.csv` format for analysis.
