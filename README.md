# ü§ñ Admittance Control for Reducing Human Physical Effort in Robot Programming through Motion Guidance

This repository contains Python scripts developed for experimental validation of **admittance control strategies** using a **UR3 collaborative robot**. The main goal is to reduce the **physical effort** required by human operators during the programming of linear trajectories, by simulating dynamic behaviors that guide robot motion through force interaction.

The system includes two main components:

- **Control Robot**: Implements an **admittance-based velocity controller** that simulates a **virtual mass-spring-damper system**. The controller restricts motion to a **single axis (X-axis)** and enables compliant, force-responsive movement during human-guided programming. This approach aims to replace the standard freedrive mode with a more controllable and ergonomic alternative, improving interaction quality and reducing user fatigue.

- **Disturbance Robot**: Applies controlled **sinusoidal forces** using the UR3's **force mode**, allowing the evaluation of the control robot‚Äôs responsiveness and robustness under external disturbances. It also includes functionality to react to sensor input (e.g., from an FSR) to simulate physical interaction or intentional interference.

## üß™ Research Context & Contributions

This project supports a study on **minimizing human physical effort** in programming-by-demonstration for collaborative robots in industrial environments. The key contributions of this work include:

- ‚úÖ Demonstrated the effectiveness of a **mass-based admittance control model** in reducing operator-applied force, particularly at **1 kg** and **5 kg** virtual mass settings.
- ‚úÖ Validated the **feasibility of admittance control** in robots like the UR3, which do not support torque-level control required for classical impedance control.
- ‚úÖ Compared the proposed method against adaptive and reinforcement-learning-based approaches, showing that a **fixed admittance model** can still achieve significant ergonomic improvements without added complexity.
- ‚úÖ Replicated the concept of **constrained task spaces** by enforcing motion only along the X-axis, allowing for isolated and measurable force interaction.
- ‚úÖ Provided a simpler, more accessible alternative to advanced adaptive methods, showing that **low-complexity controllers** can yield practical benefits in **stable, repetitive industrial tasks**.

This codebase has been used in a peer-reviewed research article focused on enhancing **human-robot interaction through force-guided motion**, contributing to the development of safer, more ergonomic collaborative robotics solutions.

## üî® Experimental Setup

This project evaluates admittance control for collaborative programming tasks using a UR3 robot, focusing on reducing the operator‚Äôs physical effort. Two types of experiments were conducted to assess the controller‚Äôs effectiveness and robustness:

### üîπ Circuit To Read Force Applied To The Sensor

- A voltage divider circuit was implemented using an Arduino to measure the force applied to an **FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor)**. The sensor is connected directly to the computer running the control robot script, and data is transmitted via serial communication.

The following image shows the schematic for the circuit:

*Figure 1: Circuit to read the force applied to the FSR sensor using a voltage divider connected to Arduino.*

### üîπ Experiment 1: Admittance Control Without Disturbance

- A single UR3 robot was used.
- The operator physically guided the robot along a **linear trajectory** (X-axis only).
- Four motion control modes were tested:
  - **Freedrive** (UR‚Äôs built-in mode)
  - **Admittance control** with virtual mass values of `1 kg`, `5 kg`, and `10 kg`
- The objective was to evaluate whether lower-mass admittance settings reduced the force needed to move the robot compared to freedrive.

### üîπ Experiment 2: Admittance Control With Disturbance (Sinusoidal Load)

- Two UR3 robots were used and **mechanically connected**.
- The **Control Robot** was operated by the human using the same linear path and the same four control modes (freedrive, 1 kg, 5 kg, 10 kg).
- Simultaneously, the **Disturbance Robot** applied a **sinusoidal force** along the X-axis using UR‚Äôs force mode, simulating interference from a tool.
- The goal was to evaluate how well the admittance control absorbed disturbances and maintained smooth, compliant motion under load.
