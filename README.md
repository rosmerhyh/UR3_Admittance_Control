# ðŸ¤– Admittance Control for Reducing Human Physical Effort in Robot Programming through Motion Guidance

This repository contains Python scripts developed for experimental validation of **admittance control strategies** using a **UR3 collaborative robot**. The main goal is to reduce the **physical effort** required by human operators during the programming of linear trajectories, by simulating dynamic behaviors that guide robot motion through force interaction.

The system includes two main components:

- **Control Robot**: Implements an **admittance-based velocity controller** that simulates a **virtual mass-spring-damper system**. The controller restricts motion to a **single axis (X-axis)** and enables compliant, force-responsive movement during human-guided programming. This approach aims to replace the standard freedrive mode with a more controllable and ergonomic alternative, improving interaction quality and reducing user fatigue.

- **Disturbance Robot**: Applies controlled **sinusoidal forces** using the UR3's **force mode**, allowing the evaluation of the control robotâ€™s responsiveness and robustness under external disturbances. It also includes functionality to react to sensor input (e.g., from an FSR) to simulate physical interaction or intentional interference.

## ðŸ§ª Research Context & Contributions

This project supports a study on **minimizing human physical effort** in programming-by-demonstration for collaborative robots in industrial environments. The key contributions of this work include:

- âœ… Demonstrated the effectiveness of a **mass-based admittance control model** in reducing operator-applied force, particularly at **1 kg** and **5 kg** virtual mass settings.
- âœ… Validated the **feasibility of admittance control** in robots like the UR3, which do not support torque-level control required for classical impedance control.
- âœ… Compared the proposed method against adaptive and reinforcement-learning-based approaches, showing that a **fixed admittance model** can still achieve significant ergonomic improvements without added complexity.
- âœ… Replicated the concept of **constrained task spaces** by enforcing motion only along the X-axis, allowing for isolated and measurable force interaction.
- âœ… Provided a simpler, more accessible alternative to advanced adaptive methods, showing that **low-complexity controllers** can yield practical benefits in **stable, repetitive industrial tasks**.

This codebase has been used in a peer-reviewed research article focused on enhancing **human-robot interaction through force-guided motion**, contributing to the development of safer, more ergonomic collaborative robotics solutions.
